### **Project Title:**  
**Single and Multithreaded Server in Java**

### **Project Description:**

This project demonstrates the implementation of both single-threaded and multithreaded servers in Java, showcasing how a server can handle requests from multiple clients efficiently. The project focuses on understanding the core differences between single-threaded and multithreaded server architectures and how each handles client-server communication.

### **Objective:**
The primary goal of this project is to implement a server that can receive and respond to multiple client requests. Through the comparison of a single-threaded server and a multithreaded server, this project highlights performance differences and the benefits of multithreading in handling concurrent connections.

### **Key Features:**
- **Single-threaded Server:**
  - Handles one client request at a time.
  - Simple architecture, where each client request is processed sequentially.
  
- **Multithreaded Server:**
  - Handles multiple client requests concurrently using threads.
  - Each client request is processed in a separate thread, enabling the server to manage simultaneous connections more efficiently.
  
- **Client-Server Communication:**
  - The server listens for incoming connections on a specified port.
  - Both server types process requests, return responses, and manage client-server interactions using Java’s `Socket` and `ServerSocket` classes.
  
- **Java Implementation:**
  - The project uses Java’s `Thread` class for multithreading, along with synchronization to ensure thread safety.
  - Exception handling and resource management (e.g., closing sockets) are incorporated to ensure a stable server environment.

### **How it Works:**
1. **Single-threaded Server:**
   - A single thread is used to handle incoming requests from clients one by one.
   - The server accepts a connection, processes the request, and sends a response before moving to the next client.

2. **Multithreaded Server:**
   - Each incoming client request is handled by a separate thread.
   - The server can serve multiple clients at the same time, improving efficiency and responsiveness, especially under high load.

### **Challenges Addressed:**
- **Scalability:**
  The project demonstrates how multithreading can help the server scale to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
  
- **Thread Synchronization:**
  The implementation of proper synchronization ensures that shared resources are managed without causing data corruption or race conditions.

### **Technologies Used:**
- Java (JDK)
- `Socket` and `ServerSocket` classes for networking
- `Thread` class for multithreading
- Exception handling and file I/O for managing client-server communication

### **Conclusion:**
By comparing the performance of single-threaded versus multithreaded servers, this project demonstrates the significant improvements in efficiency, scalability, and responsiveness that multithreading offers, especially for handling multiple client requests simultaneously.
